# This workflow runs whenever a PR is opened or updated, or a commit is pushed to main. It runs
# several checks:
# - fmt: checks that the code is formatted according to rustfmt
# - clippy: checks that the code does not contain any clippy warnin
# - test: runs the tests

# This configuration allows maintainers of this repo to create a branch and pull request based on
# the new branch. Restricting the push trigger to the main branch ensures that the PR only gets
# built once.
